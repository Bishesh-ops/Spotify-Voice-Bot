## üêõ Troubleshooting

-   **"No active device" Error:**
    -   **Fix:** Open Spotify on your phone or desktop and play any song, then pause it. The API needs to see an "active" device.

-   **"Authentication failed" Error:**
    -   **Fix 1:** Double-check your `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env` file.
    -   **Fix 2:** Delete the `.cache` file in your project folder and restart the app.

-   **Voice Not Working:**
    -   **Fix 1:** Make sure your microphone is plugged in and has permission.
    -   **Fix 2:** Try calibrating by running the app in a quiet room first.
